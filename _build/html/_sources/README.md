# Building Pathways for Open Science Education using NASA datasets

:::{note}
This is a work in progress!

You can launch the notebooks featured in this Jupyterbook on [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ESIPFed/open-data-education/master?urlpath=lab)

## Introduction

Here we will create a hypothetical scientific use case: A user wants to use the cloud to analyze change in landcover over a certain region in the Amazon Forest over a period of 20 years.  The goal of this tutorial is to introduce users to working with NASA satellite imagery and utilizing Amazon Web Services' Open Data program (updated to add searching for imagery through STAC). Through a series of standardized modules, the user will develop an end-to-end workflow for working with satellite imagery, learn about geoscientific Python tools, visualize the data and utilize a parallel computation platform on the cloud (i.e. the Pangeo Platform).
